<h2>ECO-FRIENDLY:</h2> <p>Our rolls are made from 100% organic bamboo, which is a fast growing grass giving a sustainable, natural alternative to traditional tree based toilet paper rolls. Unlike trees which can take up to 30 years to grow, bamboo grows back in as quickly as 3 to 4 months.</p>
<h2>CHEMICAL-FREE:</h2> <p>Our bamboo toilet rolls are Paraben-free, BPA free, chlorine free and hypoallergenic causing no skin rashes. They are made of pure bamboo and are highly absorbent.</p>
            <h2>SUITABLE FOR ALL DISPOSAL SYSTEMS:</h2> <p>The toilet rolls are suitable and all drainage systems as they are highly absorbent and biodegradable in nature. Clog free for disposal systems.</p>
            <h2>BIODEGRADABLE:</h2> <p>ECOSOFT toilet rolls are environmental-friendly and compostable in nature. They biodegrade in the soil within 2-6 months and have no toxic elements.</p>
            <h2>PACKAGING:</h2> <p>Plastic packaging is one of the top contributors to plastic pollution. All of our products have eco-friendly packaging and are delivered plastic-free.
Primary, secondary and transport packaging are sustainable and use the least amount of plastic we can.</p>
